String Rainy = """
Nigeria's rainy season spans April to October, bringing cooling showers that transform the landscape. Southern cities experience heavy downpours and humidity, while northern regions receive shorter but vital rainfall that rejuvenates the environment. During this period, temperatures drop noticeably across the country.

Despite cooler temperatures, staying hydrated remains essential. Adults should drink 2-3 liters (2000-3000 ml or 8-12 cups) daily, while children need 1-2 liters (1000-2000 ml or 4-8 cups). Regular hydration strengthens your immune system, improves concentration, maintains energy levels, and supports digestion. Even when not feeling thirsty in cool weather, consistent water intake helps your body function optimally..""";
String Sunny = """
Nigeria's dry season extends from November to March, characterized by scarce rainfall and rising temperatures. The southern regions experience moderate heat with occasional light showers, while the northern areas face intense heat and completely dry conditions. During this period, rivers recede, vegetation browns, and the landscape transforms as humidity levels drop dramatically across the country.

During the dry season, increased hydration becomes crucial. Adults should consume 3-4 liters (3000-4000 ml or 12-16 cups) of water daily, while children need 1.5-2.5 liters (1500-2500 ml or 6-10 cups) depending on their age and activity level. Proper hydration helps regulate body temperature during high heat, prevents dehydration from increased perspiration, supports cognitive function, and maintains skin health against the harsh dryness. Even when indoors or in shade, consistent water intake throughout the day is essential as the body loses moisture more rapidly in the dry conditions.""";
String Hamatan = """
Nigeria's Harmattan season arrives between December and February when dry, dusty winds blow from the Sahara Desert southward. This period brings extremely low humidity, hazy skies, and cooler nighttime temperatures. The northern regions experience the most intense effects with reduced visibility from dust particles, while southern areas receive milder conditions. During Harmattan, skin and respiratory issues often increase due to the extreme dryness.
The Harmattan's deceptive dryness makes hydration particularly important despite cooler temperatures. Adults should maintain intake of 2.5-3.5 liters (2500-3500 ml or 10-14 cups) daily, while children need 1.5-2 liters (1500-2000 ml or 6-8 cups). Proper hydration helps counteract the season's drying effects on mucous membranes, prevents respiratory discomfort, maintains skin moisture against cracking, and supports overall health. The dry air accelerates moisture loss from the body even when you don't feel hot, making consistent water consumption essential.
